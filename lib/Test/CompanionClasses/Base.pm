=head1 NAME

Test::CompanionClasses::Base - Base class for test companion classes

=head1 VERSION

version 1.100870

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    package My::Foo_TEST;

    use warnings;
    use strict;

    use base 'Test::CompanionClasses::Base';

    use constant PLAN => 5;

    sub run {
        my $self = shift;
        $self->SUPER::run(@_);
        is_deeply($foo, $bar, 'some test');
        # ...
    }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Base class for test companion classes. Each test companion class should
inherit from this class.

The package() property is automatically set; it holds the package name of the
class you are testing. If your test companion class is called C<My::Foo_TEST>,
then C<package()> will return C<My::Foo>.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 PLAN

A constant that says how many tests this particular class defines. Real test
companion classes (i.e., subclasses of this class) will want to redefine it
like this:

    use constant PLAN => 5;

Note that you should only specify how many tests the current class runs; test
counts of superclasses are automatically taken care of.

=head2 planned_test_count

Uses C<PLAN()>, calculated over the test companion class' whole class
hierarchy, to determine how many tests will be run in total.

=head2 make_real_object

Loads the actual class being tested (see C<package()>) and returns an object
of this class (constructed by calling C<new()> on it).

In your test companion class you will want to test certain assumptions about
your real class, so this method will be useful.

=head2 run

Test companion classes should override this method and run their tests. Be
sure to call C<SUPER::run(@_)> so that all tests over the class hierarchy are
run.

The C<run()> method in this base class just prints a line informing the test
user that tests for this particular companion class have begun. If you have
several companion classes - and you probably will or you won't have been using
C<Test::CompanionClasses> - this serves as a visual distinction of where on
companion class' tests end the next ones' begin.
