NAME
    Test::CompanionClasses - Run tests defined in companion classes

VERSION
    version 1.101370

SYNOPSIS
        # Define a test file, for example C<t/01_companion_classes.t>:

        use Test::CompanionClasses;
        run_tests;

        # Then you can do:
        # perl t/01_companion_classes.t --exact Foo::Bar Baz

DESCRIPTION
    This is a very basic frontend for Test::CompanionClasses::Engine which
    you can use for your distribution test files (in "t/").

    The intention is that you use it as shown in the "SYNOPSIS".

METHODS
  run_tests
    Parses the command-line options, then calls the "run_tests()" method of
    Test::CompanionClasses::Engine.

    You might want to make sure that the companion tests work when run
    individually as well. In that case you might use something like this:

        find lib/ -name \*_TEST.pm | \
            xargs ack -ho '(?<=^package )([\w:]+)(?=_TEST)' | \
            xargs -i{} perl t/01_companion_classes.t --exact {}

COMMAND-LINE USAGE
    The following command-line arguments are supported:

    --exact
        Specifies that the package filter is to be used exactly, i.e.,
        substring matching is not enough. See Test::CompanionClasses::Engine
        for details.

    The rest of the command line is interpreted as a list of package
    filters. Again, see Test::CompanionClasses::Engine for details.

    The "inherited" mechanism is not supported (yet).

INSTALLATION
    See perlmodinstall for information and options on installing Perl
